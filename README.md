# GettingAndCleaningCourseProject
This is the repository for the final project of Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data".

The script run_analysis.R should be run from inside the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory.
This directory contains the txt files for the training and test data.

There are 3 outputs to consider for the script :
- test_feature_activity : the 1st tidy data set
- activity_mean : the 2d dataset
- the file second_dataset.txt which is a dump file for activity_mean - the 2d dataset
